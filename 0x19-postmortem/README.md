My first postmortem
Issue Summary (that is often what executives will read) must contain:
duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone)
Duration of the Outage:
Start Time: September 25, 2024, 1:00 pm UTC
End Time: September 25, 2024, 3:52 pm UTC
What was the impact (what service was down/slow? What were user experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?)
Impact:
The User Authentication Service experienced a complete outage during this period. Users were unable to log in or register, resulting in a significant disruption to service. Approximately 80% of our user base was affected, leading to an estimated loss of 1,500 transactions per hour and numerous customer complaints.
what was the root cause
Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings that directed traffic incorrectly, leading to overloading of the primary authentication server.

Timeline (format bullet point, format: time - keep it short, 1 or 2 sentences) must contain:
when was the issue detected
1:00 PM: Issue detected via monitoring alerts indicating increased error rates.

how was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complained…)
1:25 PM: Operations team began investigating potential server overload.

actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumption on the root cause of the issue)
1:50 PM: Escalated to the development team after further investigation revealed no network issues.

misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken
2:10 PM:Misleading analysis focused on database performance; no issues found.
which team/individuals was the incident escalated to
2:50 PM: Identified a misconfigured caching layer as the root cause.

how the incident was resolved
3:52 PM: Resolved by correcting cache settings and restarting web servers.
Root cause and resolution must contain:
explain in detail what was causing the issue
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the web server's caching layer, where cache expiration settings were set too high, resulting in stale content delivery.
explain in detail how the issue was fixed
The resolution involved adjusting the cache settings to appropriate values and restarting the servers to apply changes
Corrective and preventative measures must contain:
what are the things that can be improved/fixed (broadly speaking)
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated 
configuration validation for caching during deployments.
Enhance monitoring for abnormal caching   behaviour

a list of tasks to address the issue (be very specific, like a TODO, example: patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memory…)
Tasks:
Review deployment processes for configuration management.
Develop a comprehensive caching strategy with appropriate expiration settings.
Add metrics for cache performance in monitoring systems.
Conduct regular load testing to identify potential issues before they affect users.
Be brief and straight to the point, between 400 to 600 words
By implementing these measures, we aim to enhance system reliability and improve our ability to respond swiftly to similar incidents in the future. The lessons learned from this outage will contribute significantly to our ongoing efforts in maintaining a robust web application environment.
We are constantly stormed by a quantity of information, it’s tough to get people to read you.

Duration: Start Time: September 25, 2024, 2:00 pm UTC
End Time: September 25, 2024, 6:00pm UTC
Impact: Our beloved web application decided to take an unexpected nap, resulting in slow response times and intermittent outages. Approximately 40% of users were affected, leading to a flurry of “Why isn’t this working?” messages that could rival a cat meme storm.
Timeline
2:00 PM: Monitoring alerts rang like an alarm clock on a Monday morning—high latency and errors everywhere!
2:05 PM: The operations team jumped into action, donning their digital detective hats.
2:30 PM: Initial checks showed server health was as good as a cat after a long nap—no issues found.
3:00 PM: Shifted focus to the database, suspecting it was slower than a turtle on vacation; no performance issues detected.
4:00 PM: Escalated to the development team because sometimes you just need the experts.
4:30 PM: Developers combed through logs like they were searching for hidden treasure.
5:30 PM: Eureka! A misconfigured caching layer was discovered—turns out it was hoarding stale content like a squirrel with acorns.
6:00 PM: Resolved by adjusting cache settings and restarting the servers. Service returned to normal faster than you can say “cache me outside!”
Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of our little hiccup was a caching layer that had decided to become a hoarder. With cache expiration settings set too high, users were served outdated content, leading to frustration and confusion.
How We Fixed It:
Cache Settings Adjustment: We tweaked the caching configuration to ensure that data freshness was prioritised over cache longevity—because who wants yesterday’s news?
Server Restart: After making the changes, we restarted the servers, giving them a much-needed wake-up call. Think of it as a digital cup of coffee!
Corrective and Preventative Measures
To ensure our caching layer doesn’t decide to go rogue again, we’ve outlined some corrective measures that are more effective than catnip:
Improvements/Fixes
Automated Configuration Validation: Implement automated checks during deployments to catch any misconfigurations faster than you can say “debugging.”
Enhanced Monitoring: Develop more granular monitoring for caching behaviour—because knowing is half the battle!
Specific Tasks
Review Deployment Processes: Conduct a thorough review of deployment processes to ensure that configuration management is robust—like a well-built cat tree.
Develop Caching Strategy: Create a comprehensive caching strategy that outlines best practices for cache expiration settings based on application needs and user behaviour.
Add Cache Performance Metrics: Integrate cache performance metrics into existing monitoring systems for real-time visibility into caching effectiveness—like having eyes in the back of your head.
Regular Load Testing: Schedule regular load testing sessions to identify potential performance bottlenecks before they affect users.
By implementing these measures, we aim to enhance system reliability and improve our ability to respond swiftly to similar incidents in the future. Remember, every outage is just another chance to learn—and maybe get some laughs along the way!
So here’s to better caching strategies and fewer cat-astrophes in our future!
